HRT, also called hormone therapy (HT), is the medical replacement of the female hormones oestrogen and progesterone and sometimes testosterone.
HRT is a treatment used to help manage menopause symptoms such as hot flushes and night sweats, when they are interfering with your life.HRT can provide relief for many of the common symptoms of menopause such as hot flushes, sweats, mood swings, irritability, insomnia, joint aches and vaginal dryness.
Because the symptoms of menopause, such as hot flushes and vaginal dryness, are related to fluctuating oestrogen, progesterone and sometimes testosterone levels, replacing these hormones for a period of time, helps to control these symptoms.
While there are many ways to treat hot flushes and vaginal dryness, no other treatment has been shown to be as effective as oestrogen replacement therapy.
Current guidelines recommend women who take HRT for menopausal symptoms take the lowest effective dose for the shortest time period to alleviate symptoms.
For the treatment of symptoms, women can stay on HRT for up to five years.
If HRT is taken for between one to five years it is usually considered to be âshort-term HRTâ.
For many women, symptoms of menopause usually disappear within five years and short-term HRT is all that is needed.
HRT should be reviewed regularly in consultation with your doctor.
If it is taken for more than five years, it is 'long-term HRT'.
After five years, the need to continue should be reviewed annually and the reason for taking HRT reassessed.
In 10% of women menopausal symptoms may continue for longer than 10 years and some women have menopausal symptoms into their 60s, 70s and even 80s.
These women may require HRT for symptom control for long periods.
A discussion with your doctor about how to manage menopause symptoms long-term is important if this is happening to you.
Some women can take HRT safely for many years but this must be assessed on an individual basis and be supported with regular reviews by a doctor.
Many studies have investigated whether HRT increases the risk of cancers, further illness and disease.
There have been many reports in the media about the risks of HRT.
In 2002 researchers from a large study in the United States (the Womenâs Health Initiative trial or WHI) reported the risks of HRT outweighed the benefits of taking it.
This caused an 80% drop in the use of HRT in the USA and 50% of women in Australia stopped using their HRT.
The WHI study looked at women who were many years older than the average age of menopause in Australia (51 years) and the study compared these older women who had been on HRT with women who had never been on HRT.
A recent comprehensive review of evidence on HRT has found HRT is an effective and safe treatment for the relief of menopause symptoms for healthy women.
Most studies do not show a link between weight gain and HRT use
In several studies women who used HRT had less weight gain than those who did not use HRT."
Current recommendations by world experts in menopause, including our own doctors, suggest the benefits of HRT outweigh the risks for healthy menopausal women.
If you choose HRT you should take the lowest effective dose for only as long as required for your symptoms and regularly review your reasons to continue (or not) with your doctor.
HRT can be stopped at any time â once you've stopped treatment, any increase in breast cancer risk lessens over time and is lost within 5 years.
Jean Hailes recommends each woman discuss her decision about taking HRT with her doctor regularly and whenever there are any concerns.
The recent Lancet publication of the Million Women Study (MWS) removes any lingering doubt that there's something wrong with conventional HRT.
Other studies found that these same synthetic HRT hormones increase one's risk of heart disease and blood clots (strokes), and do nothing to prevent Alzheimer's disease.
A 10-year French study of HRT using a low-dose estradiol patch plus oral progesterone shows no increased risk of breast cancer, strokes or heart attacks.
Hormone replacement therapy is a laudable goal, but it must be done correctly.
HRT based on correcting hormone deficiency and restoring proper physiologic balanced tissue levels, is proposed as a more sane, successful and safe technique.
In the short term, HRT has the benefits of improving menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes, insomnia and mood swings.
In the long term, HRT provides estrogen which can help prevent osteoporosis and bone fractures, and can reduce cholesterol levels (especially LDL or "bad" cholesterol) and protect against atherosclerosis.
Currently, about 10 percent of women in the United States takes HRT.
Almost two-thirds of women who start taking HRT stop taking it within a few years because of side-effects such as bleeding.
HRT also has some long-term risks.
Taking estrogen without progestin can cause cancer of the uterus; even with progestin, HRT can increase risk of breast cancer, heart problems, gallbladder disease and stroke.
Each woman must make an individual decision, with her doctor's help, about the risks and benefits of HRT given her own condition.
For example, a post-menopausal woman with a family history of breast cancer may not be advised to start HRT.
On the other hand, a women with no known risk for breast cancer, but with a high risk for osteoporosis, might well benefit from HRT.
Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is the most effective treatment for menopause symptoms that appear when hormone levels drop after menstrual cycles stop.
Additionally, estrogen plays an important role in controlling the bodyâs use of calcium and strengthening bones, and in raising good cholesterol levels.
According to WebMD, progesterone is also important for women taking estrogen who still have a uterus to protect against cancer of the uterus lining.
Estrogen/progesterone therapy is often medically recommended for women who have undergone hysterectomy and no longer have a uterus.
Research Shows that HRT Can Cause Ovarian Cancer
According to a February 13, 2015 BBC News Health article, research in 52 separate studies has determined that HRT increases the risk of ovarian cancer."
According to the article, University of Oxford research found one extra ovarian cancer case for every 1,000 women and one extra ovarian cancer death for every 1,700 women who use HRT for five years beginning around the age of 50.
At those rates, of the approximately 1,000,000 women using HRT in the U.S., around 1,000 will develop ovarian cancer.
Risk would be reduced for women using HRT for less than 5 years, but the risk would still be there.
Generally speaking, the American Cancer Society states that based on well-conducted studies, many physicians have become convinced that the risks of menopausal hormone replacement therapy outweigh the benefits.
In addition to increased risk of ovarian cancer, the Society reports that estrogen-progestin (synthetic progesterone) therapy has been determined to increase the risk of breast cancer.
Estrogen therapy alone has been shown to increase the risk of endometrial cancer as well as ovarian cancer.
A study published today in The Lancet looks at short-term use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and the possible increased risk of ovarian cancer.
The findings from a meta-analysis of 52 epidemiological studies, involving a total of 21488 women with ovarian cancer, almost all from North America, Europe and Australia, suggest that taking HRT for the menopause, even for just a few years, is associated with an increased risk of developing the two most common types of ovarian cancer.
This study does not provide evidence that HRT is the cause of ovarian cancer.
Millions of women are currently taking or are considering HRT, to treat significant menopausal symptoms that cause serious distress to their quality of life, will be confused or anxious by this information.
HRT, like any medication or treatment, has risks and benefits.
The very small risk that this study highlights must be put in context - in that for 1,000 women who use HRT for 5 years from around the age of 50, there will only be one extra case of ovarian cancer.
Women should consider this factor in determining whether to continue to take HRT and balance it against the proven benefits in managing their individual symptoms.
For the majority, this will mean that they will continue with treatment.
While ovarian cancer is a serious disease, this study does not prove causation, particularly when it is stated that the incidence of ovarian cancer decreases with time after stopping HRT.
Additionally, the data are observational with significant risk of bias from other contributing risk factors.
It is important to emphasise that the absolute risk is extremely small.
Women who are currently taking HRT should not be concerned by this report.
HRT is the most effective treatment for symptoms of the menopause and when HRT is individually tailored, it provides more benefits than risks for the majority of women under the age of 60, and for many beyond that age.
Studies on the use of HRT after the age of 50 suggest there is a small increased risk in breast cancer with the length of time it is used.
Other studies would suggest that this risk is only associated with some HRT regimens and not with all forms of HRT.
Having a risk factor does not mean that a woman will develop breast cancer and even if a risk factor is identified in a woman with breast cancer there is no way of proving that HRT was the cause.
Clinical studies have proved that HRT is effective for the relief of menopausal symptoms.
There is also good evidence that HRT use defers the loss of bone density.
The benefits of taking HRT for symptom relief during the menopause outweigh the risks associated with its use in most women.
