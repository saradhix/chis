Youâve probably heard it a zillion times: take some vitamin C if you feel a cold coming on, and chase away illness with a gallon of orange juice.
Ever since vitamin C was isolated in the 1930s, it has been proposed as a treatment for respiratory infections.
Perhaps no one did more to advance the case than two-time Nobel laureate Linus Pauling, who published the book Vitamin C and the Common Cold in 1970.
Pauling claimed that there was much evidence of its benefit, yet the medical profession at large claimed that it had no effect on colds.
For starters, it sets out that there is strong evidence that popping vitamin C pills everyday does nothing to prevent colds in ordinary people.
So there is no basis (in science) for ordinary people to take vitamin C for prophylactic effects.
Interestingly, however, there is good evidence it has benefits for one specific group of people: those who undertake really intense physical activity such as marathon runners.
For them, vitamin C supplementation decreases the incidence of colds by half.
These findings, though, do not hold up for ordinary people.
Regarding the therapeutic benefits of vitamin C, results are mixed and we donât really know the best method and dosage for administering the supplement.
As for relying on vitamin C to stop a cold in its tracks, there is evidence that supplements may shorten the duration of the sickness.
For adults, the Cochrane review calculated an eight per cent decrease in the duration of a cold.
For children, a 13 per cent decrease in the duration of the cold when taking vitamin C. So there are gains in taking vitamin C as a preventive for common cold, but they are relatively modest.
If youâve got a cold, and you are hoping to get rid of it faster, it is reasonable to take up to six grams of vitamin C supplements per day after the onset of the sickness.
As for prevention, intensely sporty types may want to consider taking the supplement regularly, since thereâs some evidence that it may be beneficial.
For less active people, though, there is no evidence that a daily dose will help.
Famous for its historic use to cure scurvy, vitamin C also has a long past in the prevention and treatment of the common cold.
According to the National Institutes of Health, vitamin C is considered âpossibly effectiveâ fortreating the common cold, but is ineffective for preventing it.
Despite this ranking, reviews of large numbers of studies show mixed esults about prevention and treatment.
Some demonstrate a positive effect on cold symptoms or frequency and a decreased number of colds in people exposed to extreme temperatures or physical stressors.
Other studies showed no difference in frequency, severity, or duration of cold, even with a mega-dose of vitamin C.
Because it is nearly impossible to overdose on vitamin C, large doses are often present in over-the-counter cold medicines."
Current conflicts in evidence for vitamin Câs effectiveness for cold prevention and treatment make it difficult to endorse as a true remedy to colds.
However, vitamin C is considered very safe for most people and is unlikely to cause any harm when used for colds.
Overall, many users swear by vitamin C supplements for cold prevention, and evidence suggests it shows some effectiveness as a treatment.
The authors concluded, "Under the conditions of this controlled study, in which 980 colds were treated, there is no indication that vitamin C alone, an antihistamine alone, or vitamin C plus an antihistamine have any important effect on the duration or severity of infections of the upper respiratory tract."
At least 15 studies have now shown that vitamin C doesn't treat the common cold.
As a consequence, neither the FDA, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Medical Association, the American Dietetic Association, the Center for Human Nutrition at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, nor the Department of Health and Human Services recommend supplemental vitamin C for the prevention or treatment of colds.
It can be concluded that high-dose vitamin C therapy is not effective against advanced malignant disease regardless of whether the patient had received any prior chemotherapy.
Subsequent studies have consistently shown that vitamin C doesn't treat cancer or common cold.
Vitamin C is so often suggested as a treatment for the common cold that itâs almost considered common sense.
The belief of the effectiveness of vitamin C for colds gained momentum following the publication of Vitamin C and the common cold by esteemed chemist Linus Pauling.
Pauling extensively promoted vitamin C as having a wide range of health benefits and took large regular doses of supplements.
When used as a treatment for cold symptoms in the general population, vitamin C supplements appear to do no better than a placebo, even in large doses (greater than one gram a day).
If you take vitamin C supplements every day for prevention, you still wonât avoid any colds.
But the symptoms may be milder and the duration of symptoms slightly reduced â about half a day for a typical cold lasting a week.
Itâs important to remember that we donât know if regular high-dose vitamin C supplements are entirely safe when taken over the long-term.
There is some evidence to suggest high-dose vitamin C supplements arenât safe.
We all become afflicted by the common cold at times and it would be wonderful if something as simple as vitamin C supplements made a meaningful difference.
But unfortunately, as the saying goes, many a beautiful theory has run aground on awkward fact.
Even taking the most favourable interpretation of the evidence, vitamin C supplements have only a minor effect on symptoms â and thatâs only if theyâre taken every day.
For years people have claimed that vitamin C will cure the common cold.
There has been much speculation that it can shorten or prevent colds as well.
Some studies have shown positive results while others have not, but the overall consensus is that there is no conclusive proof that vitamin C will prevent or cure a cold.
Researchers who reviewed dozens of studies on the effects of vitamin C on the common cold found that taking vitamin C routinely won't prevent colds in the general public.
Those who seem to benefit most from taking vitamin C are people who have a vitamin C deficiency and highly trained athletes and military personnel.
The studies performed on athletes and military personnel who are in very good physical shape and experience extreme conditions showed that taking vitamin C reduced their risk of catching a cold by 50%.
However, these results have not been replicated in the general public.
Some studies have shown that people who get the recommended amount of vitamin C on a regular basis may experience a slightly shorter duration if they get a cold.
The same effect does not hold true in studies where people started taking larger doses of Vitamin C only after they started to feel sick.
However, the risks are low and it's possible that taking vitamin C could work for you.
For more than half a century, people have taken Vitamin C to prevent and treat the common cold.
Despite little evidence, most people believe that Vitamin C will help them fight colds.
As a result, the average person still stocks up on it every winter or chooses food products which are enriched with Vitamin C. It could be possible that millions of people are wasting millions of dollars every year.
Our attraction to Vitamin C as a cure for the common cold started in the 1970s.
Thatâs when a man named Linus Pauling told the world to start taking heavy doses of Vitamin C. In his book How to Live Longer and Feel Better, he recommended megadoses of the vitamin to ward off the common cold, among other things.
The U.S. National Library of Medicine has an official government statement on Vitamin C and colds: the research is âconflictingâ.
This doesnât seem very clear, and thatâs because the efficacy of Vitamin C depends on who you are, where you live, and precisely what result youâre seeking when you take the supplement.
No studies have yet been able to establish a link between taking a Vitamin C supplement and preventing a cold.
Vitamin C may do something for colds, but not what you may think.
Perhaps if youâre a long-distance runner living in Iceland, you will see a benefit from Vitamin C supplementation.
The only shred of evidence supporting any positive effect of Vitamin C on the common cold was seen on people who were exerting themselves very heavily in winter environments.
It was found that taking Vitamin C supplements to prevent a cold was no more effective than taking the placebo.
In other words, mega-dosing yourself with C will not keep you from getting a cold.
It wonât even lessen your chances.
The same review study found an 8% chance that the cold would end sooner if cold weather endurance athletes took Vitamin C.
In another look-back study involving 67 different studies, remedies for the common cold, including Vitamin C supplements, were examined.
There were no clear benefits to be found in any of the research for any of the traditional remedies except for zinc and washing your hands a lot.
Taking Vitamin C wonât prevent colds but for some cold-weather athletes it might shorten the duration of their colds.
Vitamin C is obviously important, and a deficiency is life-threatening, but thereâs no evidence that taking more than you need will be beneficial, or that it will âboostâ your immune system in any useful way.
The best-known advocate of high-dose Vitamin C for the prevention and treatment of disease is Linus Pauling, who won two separate Nobel Prizes in unrelated areas before going on to become obsessed with the idea that Vitamin C can cure everything from the common cold to terminal cancer.
With respect to colds, a 2009 review concluded that Vitamin C only slightly reduces the length of a cold, and thatâs if youâve been taking it all along as a preventative (starting a supplement when you first notice symptoms doesn't help).
The review also found that supplementation did nothing to make cold symptoms less severe, and that the overall benefit is minimal.
(Interestingly, the exception was athletes training in extreme cold-weather conditions.)
