too much sun exposure can give you skin cancer on your EYEBALL.
Through sun exposure, eyeballs can develop freckles and even moles, and sometimes these become malignant and turn into ocular melanoma.
Those most at risk are people with fair skin and sunbed users.
Skin cancer is more common with increasing age and in those with blue/grey eyes.
Sunlight is essential to many living things.
But sunlight also has a dangerous side.
Over time UV radiation exposure, whether or not associated with sunburn, accelerates skin ageing making it look dry, wrinkled, loose and dull and causing pigment changes commonly known as âage spotsâ.
It can also cause changes in the skin cells, which may lead to skin cancer.
Getting too much sun can lead to skin cancer.
But getting too little sun also can be risky, especially in regions with limited sunshine, a study suggests.
Women who avoided the sun were twice as likely to die from any cause, including skin cancer, as those who had the greatest sun exposure, according to a report in the July issue of the Journal of Internal Medicine.
The sun sheds invisible ultraviolet rays which can be extremely dangerous to the skin and are responsible for sunburn, premature aging and other types of skin damage including cancer.
Agricultural workers top the list of candidates for skin cancer because they are outdoors and are exposed to the sun on a daily basis.
Skin cancer is linked to excessive sun exposure.
According to the American Cancer Society, 600,000 cases of skin cancer occur every year in the United States and out of the 600,000 cases, an estimated 8,200 end in death.
Skin cancers are caused by excessive exposure to the sun's ultra-violet rays.
It is important to remember that sunburns are not the only condition that lead to the development of skin cancer.
The risk of skin cancer is higher in places with intense year-round sunshine.
In the United States,  Arizona has the highest incidence of skin cancer.
It is important to remember that anyone, regardless of geographic location, can develop skin cancer.
By keeping exposure to the sun at a minimum,  skin cancer risks are automatically reduced.
The American Cancer Society recommends that you use a sun screen with a sun protective factor (SPF) of 15 or higher.
Children can also develop skin cancer which may not show up until later in life.
A blistering sunburn before the age of ten will double the probability of children developing malignant melanoma sometime during their lifetime.
Being exposed to the sun throughout a lifetime can be deadly.
Sun exposure is cumulative; the more sun you are exposed to and the longer you live, the greater your chances of having skin cancer.
Protecting skin from damaging ultra-violet rays is more crucial during childhood than throughout the adult years.
Although some people have a natural sun sensitivity, there are a number of medications which increase this.
With some medications sunlight exposure can trigger a fine red rash, with others, patients burn more severely or more quickly than normal.
Newton also explains that these medications, by themselves, do not increase your chances of developing skin cancer, however, serious sunburns, which can be a result of taking these medications, can increase your chance of developing skin cancer, especially in children.
The only skin cancer which we really need to be concerned with is melanoma.
The other skin cancers - basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas - can be caught in a relatively early stage and are very rarely fatal.
Excessive  sun  can exposure cause skin cancer.
However, an appropriate amount of sunshine actually prevents cancer.
Exposure to sunshine provides many health benefits, such as promoting the formation of vitamin D.
If we don't get a regular dose of sunshine, our health will suffer in many ways, one of which is depression."
We should not have excessive exposure to the sun as it is dangerous.
However, one should be outdoors for 1 hour per day if possible.
Sunscreens  can prevent the most common types of skin cancer - squamous cell and basal cell carcinomas.
But studies have failed to show clear evidence that sunscreens help prevent melanoma, the more rare but deadly type of skin cancer, according to researchers at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York.
It thus appears that getting MODERATE sun exposure is of the utmost importance.
There are some researchers who believe that the skin exposure to chlorine which we have today through bathing and swimming in chlorinated pools is the main reason we have an increased incidence of melanoma, although there is no conclusive evidence on this.
Most skin cancers are caused by exposure to the sun.
There are 2 main types of non melanoma skin cancer, basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).
A history of sunburn increases the risk of BCC.
Risk is especially high if you had several episodes of sunburn in childhood.
This has also been linked to SCC in some studies.
The risk of SCC is mainly linked to overall sun exposure through your life.
This is also linked with BCC but to a lesser degree.
The link with long term exposure to the sun means that outdoor workers, such as farm workers, gardeners and building site workers, have an increased risk of non melanoma skin cancer.
Fair skinned people, with light coloured hair and eyes, or those more likely to burn than tan, are more at risk of skin cancer.
Most skin cancers are caused by exposure to the sun.
This may be long term exposure, or short periods of intense sun exposure and burning.
The ultraviolet light in sunlight damages the DNA in the skin cells.
This damage can happen years before a cancer develops.
The sunâs rays contain 3 types of ultraviolet light.
UVA makes up most of our natural sun light.
It goes deeper into the skin and causes skin ageing.
It is now also linked to skin cancer.
UVB is most likely to burn the skin and is the main cause of non melanoma skin cancer.
UVC is filtered out by the atmosphere of the earth (ozone layer).
A history of sunburn or recreational exposure to sunlight increases the risk of basal cell carcinoma.
Risk is especially high if you had several episodes of sunburn in childhood.
It has always been thought that UVB is the main risk for skin cancer.
Sunbeds produce mostly UVA but all produce some UVB too.
UVA damages the skin and is now also linked to skin cancer.
We know the use of sunbeds causes melanoma, and there is now evidence that sunbeds may increase the risk of non melanoma skin cancer.
The evidence is strongest for a link between sunbeds and SCC.
If you have had a non melanoma skin cancer, you have a greater risk of getting another one.
According to research, you have about a 10 times higher risk of a second non melanoma skin cancer.
If you've had a melanoma, you have a 3 times higher than average risk of getting a non melanoma skin cancer.
So cover up in the sun and look out for any signs of another skin cancer.
The link between skin cancer and exposure to the sun has been raging for years.
Skin cancer rates have risen drastically in the past several decades, placing skin cancer as the most common form of cancer in the United States today.
Approximately 1.1 million Americans were diagnosed with skin cancer in 2007 alone.
Both BCC and SCC are  non-melanoma skin cancers (commonly referred to as NMSC), and they occur most   frequently.
NMSC most often appear in areas highly exposed to UV radiation, such as the face, neck, head, arms, and hands.
While  melanoma only accounts for approximately three percent of skin cancer diagnoses, it is by far the most dangerous.
Melanoma mostly occurs in people of European descent,  particularly in the United States.
Melanoma rates are highest in fair-skinned  people who are exposed to a great amount of ambient sunlight and are typically sensitive to the sun.
American Cancer Society and National Cancer Institute are interested not only in promoting healthy habits among individuals, but most importantly in preventing cancer (and most specifically, skin cancer).
Therefore, these sites are much more inclined to argue the  idea that sunlight is, indeed, a main cause of skin cancer.
Rather than proving, however, that sun exposure causes skin cancer, such web pages focus mostly on prevention, which emphasizes avoiding prolonged periods in sunlight.
Armstrong, Kricker and Fleming (1997) review the evidence of the relationship between sunlight and cancer, specifically evidence that shows sunlight has a strong connection to the cause of skin cancer.
The study found that there was a significant  Relationship between occupational UV exposure and individuals with more than  one NMSC .
Furthermore, subjects who were blue-eyes and had frequent exposure to UV  radiation tended to have more than one NMSC, and most subjects did not apply  sunscreen or wear protective clothing.
Therefore, this study revealed a link between extended sun exposure and the appearance of skin cancer later in life.
It is safe to assume that in the scientific world, the causal connection between prolonged periods of sunlight on the skin and the development of skin cancer later in life is well established.
