There are nicotine-free e-cigarette cartridges for those who want the experience of smoking but not the nicotine.,relevant,neutral
there really is a dearth of evidence one way or the other regarding the safety of e-cigarettes.,relevant,support
"The evidence that is out there, from my perusal of it, is of almost completely uniformly low quality.",irrelevant,neutral
"Particularly lacking are long-term studies of e-cigarette use, obviously because theyâ€™ve only been on the market for less than a decade and only skyrocketed in popularity beginning around five years ago.",irrelevant,support
Most e-cigarette data on safety and efficacy are derived from the surveys of current or past e-cigarette users.,relevant,oppose
"The surveys have reported successful reduction in smoking and benign side effects, such as dry mouth, throat irritation, dry cough, vertigo, headache, and nausea.",irrelevant,neutral
"Not surprisingly, given the uncontrolled nature of these studies, they showed that smokers generally liked e-cigarettes, think they help them decrease or quit smoking, and donâ€™t cause any significant problems.",relevant,oppose
"In 2009, the FDA was concerned about the content of e-cigarettes and undertook an analysis of two leading brands of e-cigarette cartridges and found that one out of the 18 cartridges contained 1% diethylene glycol, an ingredient in antifreeze that is toxic to humans.",irrelevant,oppose
Also noted were â€œcertain tobacco-specific nitrosamines which are human carcinogensâ€ in half the samples tested.,irrelevant,support

"For instance, it has been pointed out that the tobacco-specific nitrosamines found by the FDA are present in e-cigarette vapor are present at much lower concentrations than in cigarette smoke and comparable to what is found in nicotine patches.",relevant,neutral
"Given that the only chemicals found in e-cigarettes that raise significant health concerns are tobacco-specific nitrosamines and diethylene glycol (believed to be a contaminant from the use of non-pharmaceutical grade polyethylene glycol), from the standpoint of the vapor, e-cigarettes probably are safer than regular cigarettes.",relevant,oppose
"A recent technical report from Igor Burstyn of Drexel University reports that the levels of contaminants e-cigarette users are exposed to,  are insignificant, far below levels that would pose any health risk.",relevant,neutral
"Other studies have evaluated the effects of e-cigarette use on various measurable endpoints, such as plasma nicotine levels, heart rate, and expired carbon monoxide concentrations, but these were all short term studies using surrogate endpoints.",relevant,neutral
"Another study comparing tobacco cigarettes and e-cigarettes found that e-cigarette vapors produced smaller changes in lung function than tobacco smoke, but resulted in similar levels of nicotine in the blood as measured by the metabolite cotinine, while another study supports the observation of at least some adverse physiologic changes due to e-cigarette vapor.",relevant,support
"Specifically, use of an e-cigarette for 5 min was found to cause an increase in impedance, peripheral airway flow resistance, and oxidative stress among healthy smokers.",relevant,oppose
"Given that e-cigarettes are too new for long-term studies to have been done, harm from the vapor can't be ruled out, but its not unreasonable to provisionally conclude that it probably is less than tobacco smoke.",relevant,support
"The other problem, of course, is that that rigorous, well-conducted, long-term studies on e-cigarette safety are basically nonexistent.",relevant,oppose
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has NOT evaluated e-cigarettes for safety or effectiveness.,relevant,support
What studies the FDA has done have focused on limited lab studies of certain sample products on which they found significant quality control issues in the way these items are manufactured.,irrelevant,neutral

"Teenagers are apparently taking up the so-called vaping habit in droves, and now we're also learning that the exhaled vapor contains multiple harmful chemicals.That is reason enough for California to follow the lead of many municipalities by prohibiting vaping in workplaces, restaurants and other indoor gathering places, and to take stronger steps to prevent teens from buying e-cigarettes.",relevant,support

They do not produce smelly smoke or the dangerous tar that causes lung cancer.,relevant,oppose
"Nicotine, though, carries its own health risks and is a highly addictive substance, so it has been disconcerting to see the rapid rate at which teenagers who have no previous history of smoking have embraced the devices.",relevant,neutral

The report also notes the presence of toxic ingredients in e-cigarettes.,irrelevant,oppose
"Perhaps most disturbingly, it points to analyses by the National Youth Tobacco Survey that found teenagers who vaped were nearly twice as likely to try regular cigarettes and more likely to become habitual smokers.",relevant,neutral
some other studies have found potentially encouraging signs that vaping might help some smokers quit.,irrelevant,neutral
"In other words, we should not allow our concerns about the very real horrors of smoking to fill us with possibly unwarranted terror of e-cigarettes.",relevant,oppose
