"n September 23, 2014, an Italian court in Milan awarded compensation to a boy for vaccine-induced autism.",relevant,support
A childhood vaccine against six childhood diseases caused the boyâs permanent autism and brain damage.,relevant,support
"Based on expert medical testimony, the court concluded that the child more likely than not suffered autism and brain damage because of the neurotoxic mercury, aluminum and his particular susceptibility from a genetic mutation.",relevant,support
"The confidential industry document from vaccine manufacturers provided ample evidence of adverse events from the vaccine, including five known cases of autism resulting from the vaccineâs administration during its clinical trials.",relevant,oppose
"On May 23, 2012, Judge Lucio Ardigo of an Italian court in Rimini presided over a similar judgment, finding that a different vaccine, the Measles-Mumps-Rubella vaccine (MMR), had caused a childâs autism.",relevant,support
Both these Italian court decisions break new ground in the roiling debate over vaccines and autism.,relevant,support
"The courtsâ decisions are striking because they not only find a vaccine-autism causal link, but they also overrule the decisions of Italyâs Ministry of Health.",relevant,support
"And taken together, the court decisions found that both the MMR and a hexavalent thimerosal- and aluminum-containing vaccine can trigger autism.",relevant,oppose
The claim that the MMR vaccine causes autism originated with a 1998 paper published by Dr. Andrew Wakefield and 12 co-authors in the prestigious British medical journal The Lancet.,relevant,support
"Interestingly, this paper explicitly states, ""We did not prove an association between measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine and the syndrome described.""",irrelevant,neutral
"Although the paper does suggest that the MMR vaccine 'might'  be related to autism, it closes with the caution that, ""further investigations are needed to examine this regressive autism syndrome and its possible relation to this vaccine.""",relevant,oppose
"The 1998 Lancet paper put forward two hypotheses: first, that regressive autism might be caused by or related to some intestinal dysfunction and second that this intestinal dysfunction might be caused by the MMR vaccine.",relevant,oppose
"In 8 of these 12 children, behavioral regression was linked to the MMR vaccination ""either by the parents or by the child's physician.""",relevant,neutral
"In these eight children, the paper reported that behavioral symptoms occurred very soon after vaccination, roughly 6 days on average.",relevant,neutral
"Given these findings, especially the short time between the MMR vaccination and the claimed onset of behavioral symptoms, the suggestion that the MMR vaccination may have had something to do with regressive autism does not appear unreasonable.",relevant,oppose
This is still the only scientific study which posits a connection between the MMR vaccine and autism.,relevant,oppose
At least a dozen major studies have found that early childhood vaccines do not cause autism.,relevant,oppose
But one possibility remained: that immunizations could cause autism in a small group of children who were already primed to develop the disorder.,relevant,neutral
"Now, new research has ruled out that possibility too.",irrelevant,neutral
"A study of nearly 100,000 children found that toddlers known to have an elevated risk of autism were no more likely to be diagnosed with the disorder if they were vaccinated against measles, mumps and rubella than if they werenât.",relevant,neutral
"Whatâs more, the diagnosis rate for high-risk children who were vaccinated was the same as for immunized children with no family history of the disorder, according to the report published Tuesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association.",relevant,neutral
"By hunting for and failing to find a link between the MMR vaccine and autism spectrum disorders, or ASD, in children with an older sibling who had the disease, the study leaves no doubt that the two are not connected.",relevant,oppose
Abundant evidence demonstrates that the MMR vaccine does not lead to ASD in the general population.,relevant,oppose
The idea that vaccines cause autism goes back to a 1998 study in the medical journal Lancet that described 12 young children with autism-like symptoms.,relevant,support
"Eight of those children started having behavioral problems after they got the MMR vaccine, according to their parents.",relevant,neutral
"That study was retracted in 2010 after its lead author, Dr. Andrew Wakefield, was found to have falsified his research.",irrelevant,neutral
Yet his claims continue to stoke the anti-vaccination movement.,relevant,neutral
Another study published last week in JAMA found that babies born to mothers who had Type 2 diabetes before becoming pregnant were about 20% more likely to develop autism than those who did not.,irrelevant,neutral
Babies of mothers who developed gestational diabetes before 26 weeks of pregnancy were at even higher risk of developing ASD.,relevant,neutral
These findings suggest that exposure to metabolic abnormalities during a crucial period of fetal brain development may play a role in the disorder.,relevant,support
The assertion that vaccines could be linked to autism burst onto the international stage with the 1998 publication of a paper in the British journal The Lancet.,relevant,support
Sensationalist media coverage of the claim followed.,irrelevant,neutral
"The paper, which suggested a link between the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine and autism, was eventually retracted in 2010.",relevant,support
"Even before the complete retraction, however, in 2004, ten of the paper's 13 authors cosigned a partial retraction of its main interpretation.",irrelevant,neutral
"What the public didn't know in 1998 was that the now-retracted study, which involved just 12 children, would turn out to have some serious flawsâand even to contain apparently falsified data.",irrelevant,neutral
"The 12 years between its publication and its retraction, however, left a lot of time for the unfounded and never-confirmed vaccine-autism link to take hold in the minds of worried parentsâand thus for vaccination rates to suffer.",relevant,support
"Despite research showing no link between the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine and autism spectrum disorders (ASD), beliefs that the vaccine causes autism persist, leading to lower vaccination levels.",relevant,support
"In this large sample of privately insured children with older siblings, receipt of the MMR vaccine was not associated with increased risk of ASD, regardless of whether older siblings had ASD.",relevant,support
These findings indicate no harmful association between MMR vaccine receipt and ASD even among children already at higher risk for ASD.,relevant,neutral
"The Journal of the American Medical Association published a study  in 2011 titled ""Time trends in autism and in MMR immunization coverage in California""  where the authors looked for and found no association between MMR vaccination rates in young children and increased autism occurrence",relevant,oppose
"In 1999, U.S. Food and Drug Administration review of the vaccine preservative thimerosal, which contains mercury, finds no evidence of its causing neurological harm, but the agency recommends the precautionary removal of the agent from vaccines administered to infants.""",relevant,support
"In this study of 96 children with pervasive developmental disorders, the authors found no evidence of a specific syndrome being related to whether or not they had received the MMR vaccine.",relevant,oppose
"This study of 473 children with autism who were born between 1979 and 1998 offered ""further evidence against a link between MMR and autism.""",relevant,oppose
The authors found no differences in regression or bowel symptoms in those born before and after the introduction of the MMR vaccine.,irrelevant,neutral
"This study of 535,544 children in Finland found no link between MMR vaccination and autism.",relevant,oppose
"These authors describe ""strong arguments"" against the hypothesis that the MMR vaccine causes autism, based on an analysis of data from 537,303 children in Denmark, 82% of whom had received the MMR vaccine.",relevant,support
"These authors, using data from 467,450 children born in Denmark, found no link between autism risk and vaccines containing thimerosal.",relevant,oppose
"In 2004, of the 13 authors on the 1998 Wakefield paper, ten formally retract its interpretation, stating a wish to make clear that the paper established ""no causal link"" between the MMR vaccine and autism.",relevant,oppose
"The Institute of Medicine of the United States' National Academies issues a report from its Immunization Safety Review Committee, which concludes that vaccines don't cause autism.",relevant,support
"These authors looked for links between early thimerosal exposure and neuropsychological outcomes in a group of 1,047 children aged seven to ten years and found no association.",relevant,oppose
"This study of more than 1,000 children born between 1993 and 1997 found that on-time vaccination was associated with better performance on a number of neuropsychological tests.",irrelevant,neutral
"This study of over 1,000 children found no increase in autism outcomes among children who had received thimerosal-containing vaccines, compared to those who had not.",relevant,oppose
"This study of more than 1,000 children found no link between the number of antigens in vaccines and autism, and thus no support for the ""too many vaccines, too soon for children"" school of thought.",relevant,oppose
"This meta-analysis of ten studies covering more than 1.2 million children finds no links between autism and MMR vaccination, mercury, thimerosal, or vaccination generally.",relevant,oppose
"No link with autismânot to mercury, not to thimerosal, not to any vaccines, including the MMRâhas been found.",relevant,neutral
Largely ignored during this prolonged vaccine-autism controversy was clear evidence of a strong genetic influence on autism.,relevant,oppose
"For example, if one identical twin has been diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD), the other twin is from 60% to 90% more likely to also be diagnosed with an ASD.",irrelevant,neutral
"Also known is that males are more likely than females to be diagnosed with autism and that the older a father is, the higher the likelihood of a diagnosis of autism in his offspring.",irrelevant,neutral
