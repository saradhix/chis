There have been many reports in the media about the risks of HRT.,relevant,oppose
In 2002 researchers from a large study in the United States (the Womenâs Health Initiative trial or WHI) reported the risks of HRT outweighed the benefits of taking it.,relevant,oppose
This caused an 80% drop in the use of HRT in the USA and 50% of women in Australia stopped using their HRT.,relevant,neutral
The WHI study looked at women who were many years older than the average age of menopause in Australia (51 years) and the study compared these older women who had been on HRT with women who had never been on HRT.,relevant,neutral

Almost two-thirds of women who start taking HRT stop taking it within a few years because of side-effects such as bleeding.,relevant,oppose

Research Shows that HRT Can Cause Ovarian Cancer,relevant,oppose
"According to a February 13, 2015 BBC News Health article, research in 52 separate studies has determined that HRT increases the risk of ovarian cancer.""",relevant,oppose
"According to the article, University of Oxford research found one extra ovarian cancer case for every 1,000 women and one extra ovarian cancer death for every 1,700 women who use HRT for five years beginning around the age of 50.",relevant,oppose
"At those rates, of the approximately 1,000,000 women using HRT in the U.S., around 1,000 will develop ovarian cancer.",relevant,oppose
"Risk would be reduced for women using HRT for less than 5 years, but the risk would still be there.",relevant,neutral
"Generally speaking, the American Cancer Society states that based on well-conducted studies, many physicians have become convinced that the risks of menopausal hormone replacement therapy outweigh the benefits.",relevant,oppose

Estrogen therapy alone has been shown to increase the risk of endometrial cancer as well as ovarian cancer.,relevant,oppose
A study published today in The Lancet looks at short-term use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and the possible increased risk of ovarian cancer.,relevant,oppose
"The findings from a meta-analysis of 52 epidemiological studies, involving a total of 21488 women with ovarian cancer, almost all from North America, Europe and Australia, suggest that taking HRT for the menopause, even for just a few years, is associated with an increased risk of developing the two most common types of ovarian cancer.",relevant,oppose
This study does not provide evidence that HRT is the cause of ovarian cancer.,relevant,oppose
"Millions of women are currently taking or are considering HRT, to treat significant menopausal symptoms that cause serious distress to their quality of life, will be confused or anxious by this information.",relevant,neutral
"HRT, like any medication or treatment, has risks and benefits.",relevant,neutral
"The very small risk that this study highlights must be put in context - in that for 1,000 women who use HRT for 5 years from around the age of 50, there will only be one extra case of ovarian cancer.",relevant,oppose
Women should consider this factor in determining whether to continue to take HRT and balance it against the proven benefits in managing their individual symptoms.,relevant,neutral
"For the majority, this will mean that they will continue with treatment.",relevant,neutral
"While ovarian cancer is a serious disease, this study does not prove causation, particularly when it is stated that the incidence of ovarian cancer decreases with time after stopping HRT.",relevant,oppose

It is important to emphasise that the absolute risk is extremely small.,relevant,neutral
Women who are currently taking HRT should not be concerned by this report.,relevant,neutral
"HRT is the most effective treatment for symptoms of the menopause and when HRT is individually tailored, it provides more benefits than risks for the majority of women under the age of 60, and for many beyond that age.",relevant,support
Studies on the use of HRT after the age of 50 suggest there is a small increased risk in breast cancer with the length of time it is used.,relevant,oppose
Other studies would suggest that this risk is only associated with some HRT regimens and not with all forms of HRT.,relevant,neutral
Having a risk factor does not mean that a woman will develop breast cancer and even if a risk factor is identified in a woman with breast cancer there is no way of proving that HRT was the cause.,relevant,oppose
